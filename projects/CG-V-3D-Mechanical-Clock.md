# Mechanical Clock Animation  
A C++ and OpenGL project visualizing the inner workings of a mechanical pendulum clock.

## Repository name:

[CG-V-3D-Mechanical-Clock](https://github.com/JSzyba/CG-V-3D-Mechanical-Clock)

## Collaboration

This project was developed with [Jakub Szybura](https://github.com/JSzyba) as part of a university assignment in a computer graphics course. 
Each team member contributed to design, logic, and implementation of different components.

## Overview

This project simulates a fully animated mechanical clock, including all key internal components such as gears, pendulum, weights, and the escapement mechanism. 

## Key Features

- Complete animation of internal clock mechanisms
- Option to toggle visibility of specific components for better clarity
- Free camera movement for exploration of the 3D scene
- Clock rotation along the Y-axis
- Adjustable animation speed to facilitate demonstration or detailed observation
- Realistic lighting system with four point lights to enhance depth and visual clarity

## User Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| W / A / S / D | Rotate the camera |
| Z / C | Move camera forward and backward |
| O | Toggle visibility of some clock parts |
| left and right arrow keys | Rotate the clock |
| I / K | Increase or decrease animation speed |

## Technologies Used

- **C++** – Core application logic
- **OpenGL** – Real-time rendering and lighting
- **Assimp** – Importing and managing 3D models
